          <p>
            These Terms of Service (&ldquo;<strong>Terms</strong>&rdquo;) constitute a legally binding agreement between
            you (&ldquo;<strong>User</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>you</strong>&rdquo;) and Sjoh (Pty) Ltd, a private
            company duly incorporated in accordance with the company laws of the Republic of South Africa
            (&ldquo;<strong>Sjoh</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>we</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>us</strong>&rdquo;, or
            &ldquo;<strong>our</strong>&rdquo;), governing your access to and use of the Sjoh website, mobile application
            and related services (collectively, the &ldquo;<strong>Platform</strong>&rdquo;).
          </p>
          <p>
            By accessing, browsing, registering for or otherwise using the Platform, you acknowledge that you have read,
            understood and agree to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other policies referenced herein.
            If you do not agree to these Terms in their entirety, you must refrain from using the Platform.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold">2. Definitions</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>&ldquo;Customer&rdquo;</strong> means a User who posts a request for services or otherwise seeks to engage a Service Provider via the Platform.</li>
            <li><strong>&ldquo;Service Provider&rdquo;</strong> or <strong>&ldquo;Pro&rdquo;</strong> means a User who lists services or responds to requests for services on the Platform.</li>
            <li><strong>&ldquo;Content&rdquo;</strong> means any text, images, videos, ratings, reviews, listings, quotations or other material submitted to or made available on the Platform.</li>
            <li><strong>&ldquo;Subscription Fee&rdquo;</strong> means any recurring fee payable by a Service Provider for access to enhanced Platform features.</li>
            <li><strong>&ldquo;Transaction&rdquo;</strong> means any agreement entered into directly between a Customer and a Service Provider for the provision of services.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold">3. Nature of the Platform</h2>
          <p>
            Sjoh operates a neutral technology platform that facilitates the introduction of Customers to independent
            Service Providers. Sjoh is not a party to any Transaction concluded between Customers and Service Providers,
            does not employ Service Providers, and does not act as an agent, broker, contractor, insurer, guarantor or
            fiduciary in respect of any Transaction. Service Providers are independent third parties who contract directly
            with Customers and bear sole responsibility for the performance of their services.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold">4. Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>
          <p>
            You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age and possess the legal capacity to enter into binding contracts
            under South African law in order to register an account. You undertake to provide accurate, current and
            complete information during registration and to maintain such information. You are solely responsible for
            safeguarding your account credentials and for all activities undertaken under your account.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold">5. Service Provider Obligations</h2>
          <p>Service Providers represent, warrant and undertake that they shall:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>hold all licences, registrations, permits, qualifications and insurances required by South African law to perform the services they offer;</li>
            <li>perform all services in a professional manner consistent with industry standards applicable in the Republic of South Africa;</li>
            <li>comply with all applicable laws, including without limitation the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008, the Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993, the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962, and the Value-Added Tax Act 89 of 1991;</li>
            <li>not engage in any conduct constituting misrepresentation, extortion, intimidation or unfair commercial practice;</li>
            <li>respond to Customer enquiries in good faith and within a reasonable period.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold">6. Customer Obligations</h2>
          <p>Customers undertake to provide accurate descriptions of the services required, to honour quotations expressly accepted via the Platform, and to deal fairly and in good faith with Service Providers.</p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold">7. Fees, Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
          <p>
            Sjoh charges Service Providers Subscription Fees and may charge optional fees for value-added features
            (including, without limitation, urgent lead boosts). All fees are quoted exclusive of value-added tax unless
            expressly stated otherwise. Subscription Fees are billed in advance on a recurring basis and are non-refundable
            save as required by applicable law. Sjoh reserves the right to amend its fee schedule upon thirty (30) days&rsquo;
            written notice to affected Users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sjoh does not collect, hold or process payments in respect of the underlying Transaction between a Customer and
            a Service Provider. All such payments are settled directly between the parties.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold">8. Reviews, Ratings and User Content</h2>
          <p>
            Users grant Sjoh a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, sub-licensable licence to host, store,
            reproduce, display and distribute Content submitted to the Platform for purposes reasonably connected to the
            operation, promotion and improvement of the Platform. Users warrant that they own or have obtained all rights
            necessary to grant the foregoing licence and that their Content is accurate, lawful and not defamatory.
            Sjoh reserves the right, but is not obliged, to moderate, edit or remove Content that contravenes these Terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Platform is provided on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as
            available&rdquo; basis without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied or statutory. Sjoh does not
            warrant the qualifications, conduct or work product of any Service Provider, nor the accuracy of any listing,
            review or other Content. Customers are solely responsible for satisfying themselves as to the suitability of any
            Service Provider before engaging them.
          </p>

          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, Sjoh, its directors, employees, contractors, suppliers and affiliates

            including without limitation loss of profits, loss of goodwill, loss of data or business interruption, arising
            out of or in connection with your use of the Platform or any Transaction. Sjoh&rsquo;s aggregate liability to any
            User in any twelve (12) month period shall not exceed the total Subscription Fees paid by that User to Sjoh during
            such period, or one thousand Rand (R1 000.00), whichever is the greater.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit any liability that cannot lawfully be excluded or limited under
            South African law, including liability arising under the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold">12. Indemnity</h2>

            against any and all claims, demands, actions, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal
            fees on the attorney-and-own-client scale) arising out of or in connection with: (a) your breach of these Terms;

            Sjoh may, in its sole discretion and without liability, suspend or terminate your access to the Platform, with

            or pose a risk to other Users or the integrity of the Platform. You may close your account at any time by
            following the procedure made available within the Platform.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold">14. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>
            All intellectual property rights in and to the Platform (excluding User Content) are and shall remain the

            email or via a prominent notice on the Platform not less than fourteen (14) days before they take effect. Your
            continued use of the Platform after the effective date of any amendment constitutes acceptance of the amended
            Terms.
